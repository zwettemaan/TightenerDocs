# Minimal Registry Data

The Tightener Registry holds minimal data - it is essentially a bunch of GUIDs which represent capability slots and individual machines and it tracks the relation between those GUIDs.

The data for those entities is stored on the individual computers - the supplier's computer holds the data relating to their products and activations, the customer's computer holds the data about their accounts, machines and activations.

The registry is but a go-between that expresses the relation between the various entities, but there is no data in the registry about any of those entities.
