# Developer Tiers

One of the core ideas behind Tightener is to help small developers become successful, and grow their business.

In order to do that, we're classifying developers into a number of tiers:

- Charity/Not-for-profit
- Small
- Medium
- Large

There are no hard and set rules regarding this classification: when registering for a developer account, there is a negotiation where we determine the tier of developer.

Some rough classifications:

Charities and not-for-profits should be fairly obvious.

Small developers are one- or two-man bands, who don't do development as their main source of income. 

Medium developers are companies with two or more people, who have an established business and make a living with their company

Large developers are companies with five or more people who have a revenue over US$ 1,000,000 per year.

A developer classification is reviewed every year, and our aim is to generate an upward momentum, so small developers become medium developers, and so on...
