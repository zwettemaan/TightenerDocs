# Developer Install

Note: at the time of this writing, Tightener is still in the Alpha stage.

The developer version of Tightener integrates the Tightener eco-system into your
command line environment. Mac, Windows and Ubuntu Linux are supported.

There is also an end-user version of Tightener, which is largely invisible. 
It is embedded into the [PluginInstaller](PluginInstaller.md). If you need Tightener for UXP, you can get 
by with just installing the [PluginInstaller](PluginInstaller.md); you don't need to install the full Tightener
developer version.
