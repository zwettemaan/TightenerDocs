# Installing

There are two common approaches to installing Tightener: a 'light' version for end-users,
and a 'full' version for developers.

End-users would install just the License Manager, which has an embedded copy of the light
version of Tightener

Developers would install the full version of Tightener, which provides an extensive range of 
command-line tools for using, developing, monitoring, testing, configuring...

## Installing the License Manager

To install the license manager, visit

https://store.tgrg.net

and download the latest version. There is no installer - you simply 'unzip' the download, and move the downloaded folder
to some convenient location, then double-click the LicenseManager.app or LicenseManager.exe file.

The user would create and register at least one account, then download catalog entries from one or more software developers.

Once the catalog entries have been loaded, the user can then order a license file from a supplier, and once the order is fulfilled,
activate the software that they want to use.

## Installing a full version

Download a copy of a Tightener release from the [Releases](https://github.com/zwettemaan/TightenerDocs/Releases) folder

Decompress and move to a convenient spot.

Start a command line window into the Tightener folder and run the install script (install.command for Mac/Linux, install.bat for Windows)

Uninstalling is done by running the uninstall script.

You would also install a copy of the License Manager, and switch it to developer mode to create a developer account.
