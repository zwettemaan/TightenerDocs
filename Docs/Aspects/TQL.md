# TQL

TQL is Tightener's internal scripting language. It is like a primitive version of JavaScript.

There are many sample scripts in the full Tightener release folder.

TQL is not geared to write large solutions with - it's intent is mainly to facilitate the 'automation glue' part of the Tightener.

However, the InDesign Tightener plugin does have access to the full InDesign DOM via TQL - no need to round-trip via ExtendScript or UXP.
