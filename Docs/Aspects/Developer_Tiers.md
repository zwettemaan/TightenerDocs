# Developer Tiers

One of the core ideas behind Tightener is to help small developers become successful, and grow their business.

In order to do that, we're classifying developers into a number of tiers:

- Charity/Not-for-profit
- Small
- Medium
- Large

There are no hard and set rules regarding this classification: when registering for a developer account, there is a negotiation where we determine the tier of developer.

Some rough classifications:

Charities and not-for-profits should be fairly obvious.

Small developers are one- or two-man bands, who don't have their software development business as their main source of income. 

Medium developers are companies with two or more people, who have an established business and make a living from the profits of their company.

Large developers are companies with ten or more people who have a revenue around US$ 2,000,000 per year or more.

A developer classification is reviewed every year, and our aim is to generate an upward momentum, so small developers become medium developers, and so on...
