# Multiple Accounts

PluginInstaller allows the creation of multiple accounts even when using the same email address. 

This gives the user an option to use different accounts for different types of orders (e.g. from a specific supplier, for a specific service or department,...)

Email addresses are not permanently stored in the registry
