# Automation Glue

[Tightener](What_is_Tightener.md) is automation glue. It's not a functional software product in its own right.

Tightener can be integrated as a component into a software or script, and provides useful services to that software or script.

There is a wide range of services offered; the aim is to make it easier on people with domain knowledge to express their knowledge into software, without getting mired into boring infrastructure details.

Tightener has multiple possible integration paths: 

- into [ExtendScript](ExtendScript_Integration.md) (as an ExtendScript DLL)
- as an HTTPS-based API that is accessible from UXP
- embdedded into standalone command line apps (the Tightener [executable](Tightener_Executable.md))
- into GUI apps ([License Manager](License_Manager.md))
- into Xojo apps ([XojoTightener.xojo_plugin](XojoTightener.md))
- into InDesign C++ plugins
- as a DLL/dylib
- compiled straight into C++ code
- ...
