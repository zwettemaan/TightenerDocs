# Command Line

Tightener can be more or less present and obvious to the computer user, all depending on the context. 

For end-users, Tightener would be mostly invisible - they might need to use the License Manager to handle licensing and activation, but that might be the end of it.

For developers, Tightener can be installed with a whole host of infrastructure and helper scripts. 

The developer release of Tightener comes with a large amount of command-line scripts, and as a developer, you should familiarize yourself with the command-line interface of Tightener.

For source-code licensees, Tightener would be represented by a number of git repositories which interrelate and reference each other.
