# No Payment Handler

The Tightener Licensing infrastructure does not include a payment handler - that is left to the supplier. 

This can be as simple as having a manual PayPal transaction, or as complicated as a fully automated payment handling system that uses PayPal or Stripe or similar to handle the payment.

Tightener has an API that can be called to handle the generation of the activation codes once payment has been received.
