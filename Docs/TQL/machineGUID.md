# machineGUID

`machineGUID()`

This function call retrieves the current computer's machine GUID - this is a unique GUID associated with a particular computer.

All computers that run Tightener get a unique GUID assigned to them. This GUID is stable, but will change when necessary (e.g. 
when cloning a computer via a backup or image backup, either the clone or the original will receive a new GUID).
