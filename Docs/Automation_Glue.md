# Automation Glue

Tightener is automation glue - it's not a functional software in its own right.

Tightener can be integrated as a component into a software or script, and provides useful services to that software or script.

There is a wide range of services offered; the aim is to make it easier on people with domain knowledge to express their knowledge into software, without getting mired into boring infrastructure details.
