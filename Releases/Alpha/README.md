# Unstable, variable release

IMPORTANT: the zip file you find here is not persistent or stable - it 
continuously changes, despite the fact that the file name
will often remain the same.

You'll see Tightener.x.x.x.zip today in this Github repo, and
you'll see Tightener.x.x.x.zip tomorrow but it will be a different file. 

This file is part of my testing setup, in preparation of the official release

The actual release will only become 'frozen' once it gets listed
below as a downloadable file on cloud.rorohiko.com
