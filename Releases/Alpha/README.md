## Version 0.1.0

Sixth alpha release, 23-Apr-2023

This version adds support for ARM64 on Windows and Linux.
The reason for that is that I've got a new M2 MacBook Pro, 
and I wanted to be able to build and test Tightener on it.

I've made new build scripts which can cross-compile to ARM64 
on x64 systems and also cross-compile to x64 on ARM64 systems.
This is what I am now using on my M2 Mac - the Mac build is
done on the machine itself, and the Linux and Windows builds are 
done on ARM64 virtual machines (Ubuntu Linux and Windows 11)
which then also compile the x64 versions (including InDesign
plug-ins)
